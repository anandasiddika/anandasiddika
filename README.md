## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ananda Adkhilny Siddika, what's unique about my name is not everyone can pronouns my middle name right. People call me Ananda most of the time. I have interest in studying more about Earth Science and Astronomy, also find Japan interesting. I also like learning some foreign languages. I'm currently an undergraduated Geophysics student in Universitas Gadjah Mada and currently searching for my fixed interest. My current hobbies are writing and reading comics, also watching animes in my free time, and sleeping or getting rest most of the time.
